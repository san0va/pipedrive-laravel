# PaidYET Dashboard for Pipedrive
The PaidYET Dashboard App for Pipedrive allows you to access PaidYET's Payment Gateway API to link card-on-file information to your Pipedrive Contacts.  

Our PCI compliant virtual terminal widget allows you to charge a card to your PaidYET Merchant Account, recording the transaction to your Pipedrive activity log.

# Login with your Pipedrive account #

# How to process a payment
When you first attempt to charge a card you will be prompted to enter your PaidYET Subdomain (yoursubdomain.paidyet.com), and your API Key.

Your API key can be found by first logging into PaidYET's payment gateway here: https://dashboard.paidyet.com/

And then creating a new API key from your tools page here: https://dashboard.paidyet.com/tools#accesspoints
